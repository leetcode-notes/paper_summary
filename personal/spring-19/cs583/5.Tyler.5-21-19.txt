  Concurrent programming in Haskell.

- How does the paper approach/solve the problem? 
  i.e. which FP techniques are applied?
  introduces an EDSL for concurrency programming in Haskell.

- What is the scope of the method/solution?
  concurrency!

- What are the limitations?
  idk


Questions/comments:
- First off, thanks for picking this paper. It was quite enjoyable
  reading it and seeing my progress in understanding more complicated
  Haskell code. I specifically enjoyed their laws and their discussion
  on why they needed to do this and what was the result of using it in
  their VMs in Galois. I didn't have enough time to go through the 
  `auction` example thoroughly so I'd like to get a chance to go 
  through it maybe when you present the paper.
- Just to check my understanding, the `notBefore` function waits `w`
  time to return the result of `p`, right?
