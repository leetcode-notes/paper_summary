Functional Programs that Explain their Work,
R. Perera, U. A. Acar, and J. Cheney

Sections: ?

Summary:

Points to get out of the paper:

- What is the paper about?
  explaining functional progs

- What problem does it address?
  how do parts of a higher-order functional prog have been computed

- How does the paper approach/solve the problem? 
  i.e. which FP techniques are applied?
  by trace slicing and unevaluation prog

- What is the scope of the method/solution?
  prog explanation and debugging

- What are the limitations?
  idk


Questions/comments:
- Why is it that understanding and explaining computations and their 
  results ofen runs agains the desire to treat a computation as a 
  black box that maps intputs to outputs? If the explanation is given 
  in a high-level language or like a story in natural language that 
  wouldn't be the case. Wouldn't this depend more on the kind of 
  explanation one chooses?
- I'm confused about slicing criterion, it seems NOT FINISHED!!
- What makes a slicing criterion more flexibile? Any formal 
  definition?
- When is a slicing forward and when is it backwards?
- Why is it that they mention that slicing at the granularity of 
  variables is too coarse-grained? It seems the other way to me!
- How does strictness and laziness play a role in program slicing? I
  know how they influence the program tracing but I'm not so sure 
  about their effect on program slicing.
