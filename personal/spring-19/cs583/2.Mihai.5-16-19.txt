Asynchronous Functional Reactive Programming for GUIs
E. Czaplicki and S. Chong

Sections: 1-4

Summary:

Points to get out of the paper:

- What is the paper about?
  Building GUIs with FP.

- What problem does it address?
  1) unnecessary recomputation and 2) global delays while building 
  GUIs with functional reactive programming.

- How does the paper approach/solve the problem? 
  i.e. which FP techniques are applied?
  using asynch funcitonal reactive programming. i.e., combining a 
  simply-typed FP with a small set of reactive primitives.

- What is the scope of the method/solution?
  introducing a core lang FElm, translating Elm to the core lang.
  then translating FElm to an intermediate lang that executes the
  functional part and produces signals. then finally evaluate the 
  signals.

- What are the limitations?
  I can't remember but they mentioned a couple of things and said
  that they're not that much of a big deal!


Questions/comments:
- Why is it that discrete signals generalize continuous ones?
- Is FElm statically typed or dynamically?!
- Thanks for picking this paper, it gave me a couple of ideas for 
  my research :)
