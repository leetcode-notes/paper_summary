Summary notes:
Summary:
The authors purpose an extension to Java, called MultiJava, that adds
open classes and multiple dispatch. Open classes are a solution to the
expression problem in OOP, i.e., one can extend operations modularly. And
they don't have the disadvantages of the Visitor pattern, e.g., having
to plan ahead. Multiple dispatch provides a solution to the binary method
problem, i.e., the use of double-dispatching.


Take home(s):
Open classes provide a solution to the expression problem for OO programming
languages by allowing extension of new types and operations modularly.

Questions/topics for discussion:
- Open classes look like an interesting idea to solve expression problem. Is
  there a counterpart in FP?
