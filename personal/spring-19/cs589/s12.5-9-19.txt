Summary:
The paper discusses the use of type classes to overcome some of the
problems posed by software extension and inetgration in a modular
manner. Thoughtful implementation of single parameter type classes
provide a solution to problems such as the adapter problem, the 
tyranny of the dominant decomposition, and the expression problem.
While the multi-parameter type classes can address multi dispatching,
family polymorphism, and framework integration. Although, doing so
introduces some new strengths and weaknesses compared to current SE
approaches.

Take home(s):
- Type classes can be used as a mechanism to solve some of the 
  software extension and integration problems by lifting the concern
  from the value level to the type level.
- It's good practice for researchers to think and expose themselves
  to problems of other fields and try to solve within the techniques
  of their own field. Who knows what one could come up with!

Questions/topics for discussion:
- Their solution to the expression problem doesn't seem modular to me
  in terms of cohesion! Thoughts?
- Could we discuss disadvantages of using type classes to solve the
  expression problem?
- I didn't grasp the concept of multi dispatching!
- What is associated types?
