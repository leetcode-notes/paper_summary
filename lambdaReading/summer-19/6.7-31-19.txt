Ch 16: Equity and diveristy

Comments:
- I like that they used narratives instead of stereotypes.
- It was really eye opening for me to have the definitions of equlaity
  and equity and the example they gave reagarding women's groups are
  unfair. they just taught me an extra way to argue about this kinds of 
  things!
- p 485, they have a huge emphasis on groups of people but to me 
  interpreting every single situation goes back to the individual's 
  background. ex of my own experience. I'm not saying that some similar 
  patterns doesn't exists among some certain groups but I think we can
  change individual's perspective on how to percieve others behavior 
  instead of trying to fight these old narratives, at least this seems 
  more possible and easier to me!
- I have to say the result that they talk about in page 486 is really 
  disturbing and disappointing!
- I found their recommendations (transparent teaching and active learning
  and communicating the purpose of tests) in p 491 somehow useful. 
- I definitely take a more personal approach towards people behavior than
  the groups that they belong to and don't necessarily even identify as such!
  Which is against the author's opninion in p 492.
- I also disagree with forcing students voicing their answers or questions 
  or comments. I'm wondering how others feel about this? p 493
  disagree with their recommendations 16.2.2.2
- the pressure from being spotlit really resonated with me both on a personal
  and professional level! p 493
- just out of curosity for the experience educators in the room, have you ever
  had to make an intervention about a comment that a student made in class? p 496
