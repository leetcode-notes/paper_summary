ch 0, ch 1

Comments:
- enjoyed the detailed informative description of how they wrote 
  this book and collaborated with all the authors.
- the problems they mention as novices' difficultites with 
  programming seems very similar to problems when one is defining
  a new problem: 1) how to translate a real world problem to 
  notations and formalize it and 2) the limitations we usually 
  consider to kick things off (how general the problem is going
  to be).
- the superbug problem seems rather interesting (just the fact that
  it exists). do you come across it in your classes and in interactions
  you have with your students?
- I like to know people's thoughts on the question:
  "what is the best PL for novices?"
  do you think it's even a valid question to ask.
- I like to know people's thoughts on their preference for 
  coding/debugging in pairs/groups/alone?
- I really enjoyed the Papert and Pea debate p21. rather on point.
- I really really enjoyed the phenomenography. it really connected with
  some of my personal beliefs!!

Should-read:
