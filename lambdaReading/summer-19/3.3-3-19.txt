Chapter 12 from 12.3.5 to end

Comments:
- I liked the cognitive load section and its principles. I think
  it's important as a teacher to know how we can reduce the 
  cognitive load for our students in assignments and class.
- Learning Edge Momentum seems to talk about what Martin was saying
  last week that we don't have enough sufficient knowledge of 
  computing in most high schools.
- the avg ex in p354 could be used to argue start off teaching 
  programming right by teaching fp.
- I totally agree with the argument they're having about having 
  specificly designed languages for teaching programmin in CS1 
  instead of using commercially popular langs. (p 355)
- the idea of setting the course at the avg level and have both
  extension work and targeted support for high-achieving and 
  struggling students seems to be effective. but the question is
  how would a teacher know the avg of class beforehand?
