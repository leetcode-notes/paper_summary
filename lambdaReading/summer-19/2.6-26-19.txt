- Is programming a uniquely intellectual activity? it seems to me that
  it's more of a skill that people develop over time, sometimes even 
  without enough conceptual understanding of it, due to high demand in
  industry. thoughts? (p328)
- "good programmers are born, not made". definitely not agree! thoughts?
  (p330)
- "programming is artistic (creative) and not scientific". strongly 
  disagree! it's creative but the science part makes it creative. 
  thoughts? (p330)
- what a sterotipic claim: programmers are typically male and wihtdrawn from
  scoiety! really annoyed by this part! the author is so obviously a man!!
  (p330)
- totally agree with their comment that CS1 is typically regarded 
  difficult to student and can relate to it. (p330)
- how are programs created opportunistically? (p334) (if time allows!)
- it'd be insteresting to conduct studies of how different and novices 
  understand specific fields of CS (p336)
- hands down, an essential concept of CS is abstraction (p338)
- can relate to the distinction between conceptual and practical 
  knowledge, specifically with monads. (p339)
- "different PL afford different features of a notional machine, that they
  can be used to explain hidden actions and side effects of a program's 
  operation" --> wouldn't this be a good argument to advocate starting of
  CS students with a pure FP?
