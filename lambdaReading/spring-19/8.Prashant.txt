Summary:


Notes:
* too lazy/busy to take notes!

Comments:
- Did this catch on? Ie, is there a practical language that is total FP?
  esp with existence of dep type langs.
- totally agree that using the primitive recursion and limiting a lang to
  just primitive recursion although painful at first is great for teaching
  like Pie.
