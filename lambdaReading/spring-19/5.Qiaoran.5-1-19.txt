Comments:
- it was an interesting, I'd like to read the next chapter!

In-meeting comments:
- Ameya: transformation is a mapping!! is it tho here?

- Marting: 
  - non-termination is one way to get bottom but it's not bottom itself
  - den sem: map AST to sets
  - provig meaning-preserving transformation can be done in both op sem and
    den sem. while in den sem you may need to deal with CPOs if you have
    an operation for introducing functions and you have recursion. but you 
    don't need to do this in op sem. thesedays you don't see ppl using 
    den sem that much. but both approaches have inductive proofs. 
  - CPO: complete partial order! look into it! 
  - changing the strictness of a function matters when you throw it an 
    infinite data structure
  - Knuthâ€“Bendix completion algorithm discusses how to apply optimization
    rules in such a way that you don't get stuck in an infinite loop
