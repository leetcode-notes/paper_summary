Functional Pearl: Trouble Shared is Trouble Halved

Summary:
they make an attempt at achieving a better performance in applying
recursive functions with a potential for memoization over inductive
data types that could serve as memo structures, like nexuses. 

Notes:
- nexus: a tree that contains shared nodes, nodes that have 
         more than one incoming arc. Note that they still 
         may have more than one outgoing arc too.
- boolean lattice: In abstract algebra, a Boolean algebra or 
                   Boolean lattice is a complemented 
                   distributive lattice. This type of algebraic 
                   structure captures essential properties of 
                   both set operations and logic operations.

- memo structure: features constant time access to memoized 
                  function calls

Comments:
- it was fun working through their examples and trying to
  make sense of it. it also seems interesting what their 
  proposing if it can be generalized to some specific 
  group of problems.
- so a nexus is essentially a directed graph, right? with 
  no self cycle kind of thing
- zoomorphism?
