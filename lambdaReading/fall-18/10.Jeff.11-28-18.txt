Functional Pearl: Enumerating the Rationals
@https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/rationals.pdf

Summary:

Notes:
- enumerating an infinite list of infinite lists is only possible 
  if you traverse its finite diagonals which is an infinite list 
  of finite lists. Note that these are upper right to lower left 
  diagonals.
- m/n and m'/n' represent the same rational iff they have the 
  same path in the gcd (greatest common divisor) tree constructed
  based on Eucilid's subtractive alg
- each row of the Stern-Brocot gives you the simpleset rational 
  numbers you haven't seen yet
- the adv of Calkin-Wilf tree is that you can enumerate the 
  rationals without creating an intermediate list (shown in rats6)
  while that wasn't the case for the Stern-Brocot tree (shown in
  rats5)
  
Comment:
- It was just cool to read esp after the first sectin and
  seeing the mathematics and relationships between different
  ways to construct trees with the same elements but different
  structure

In-meeting comments:
- Julia has statically interpreter
- book to look into mentioned by Eric: Numbers and games
- unfold basically acts like a generator, you give it a function
  and a base case and it'll generate a list for you
