A short introduction to systems F and F_w

Notes:
- In computer science, extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF) is a 
  family of metasyntax notations, any of which can be used to 
  express a context-free grammar. EBNF is used to make a formal 
  description of a formal language such as a computer programming 
  language. They are extensions of the basic Backusâ€“Naur form 
  (BNF) metasyntax notation.

Comments:
- didn't like some of the notations and definitions like operational
  semantics or the def of parameter/argument. 

In-meeting comments:
- Martin:
  * TermVar isn't defined in fig.1.
  * we don't need grouping in fig.1 since they're showing abstract 
    syntax which is a linear representation of terms and hence we 
    don't need the grouping.
  * order practically counts the number of arrows in the argument.
  * the `*` that they're using for ground type and kind is unfortunate
    overlapping that could confuse an innocent reader!
