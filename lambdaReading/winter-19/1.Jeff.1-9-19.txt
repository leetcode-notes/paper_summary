Notes:


Comments:
 - interesting to look at excel as a build system!
 - interesting to learn about build systems by their DSL.
 
In-meeting comments:
Eric: 
 - nice way to use Haskell (FP) to model a domain.
 - one of the main goals is to understand the domain.
 - fig5: getvalue doesn't have Maybe b/c they're setting
   the values to some default value using the func (k -> v)
   in initialise.
Martin:
 - maybe you could sacrifice some of the generality for 
   ease of use.
 - generally a problem in domain specific lang desing.
 - it's generic programming and not type-level programming.
 - excel isn't imperative in nature. while build systems are.
 
- type level programming: having computation in type level,
  i.e. effective functions at type level, you can easily do this
  with dep type langs but you can also do it with Haskell by
  going through some loops.
- really cool to pass type class as an argument to a type 
  constructor. keep in mind that you have to turn on data kind.
