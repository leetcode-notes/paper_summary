Propositions as Types 
@https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2699407


Summary:
- propositions as types (for each proposition in the logic there 
  is a corresponding type in the programming lang and vice versa).
- proofs as programs (for each proof of a given proposition there 
  is a prog of the corresponding type and vice versa).
- simplification of proofs as evaluation of program (for each way 
  to simplify a proof thre is a corresponding way to evaluate a prog).
- this deep correspondence has inspired automated proof assistants.

Notes:
- effectively calculable is defined by means of three definitions:
  lambda calculus, recursive functions, and Turing machines.

Comments:
- It was a nice brief explanation to Curry-Howard correspondence.
  I also like that he explains it step by step.
  I rememeber the first time I read it, it took me some time to 
  digest that simplifying proofes corresponds to evaluating progs.
- I liked the ph that he draws the reader attention to meta and obj
  lang, especially how he wraps it up by saying that "to understand 
  implication one must first understand implication!"
